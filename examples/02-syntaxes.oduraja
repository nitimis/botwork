# A very basic log statement

Log |"Hello, World!"|

###
As you will see, a statement is a plain english sentence with zero or more parameters.
parametes are expressions/literals enclosed within pipe symbol `|`.
Each line is a single statment. And all statements are case-insensitive (but the variables used inside parameters are still case-sensitive). 
Statements (except assignment) cannot begin with parameters.
Statements cannot also begin with reserved keywords like (if, for, while, else, return, continue, etc).
But it can still contain the reserved keyworkds in the middle of the statement
They also cannot contain curly-braces "{", "}", pound sign "#", or new lines.
Every statement will always return a Literal (None, Bool, Int, Float, String, Array, Map)

# Here are some different ways you can write the same `Log` statement in
# They all do the same as the Log statement above

log |"Hello, World!"|
LOG |"Hello, World!"|
Log|"Hello, World!"|
Log   |"Hello, World!"|
   Log   |"Hello, World!"|


# Assignment statments: It always starts with a parameter followed by `=`
# The RHS can be a parameter or a sentence.

|a| = |(4 + 5) * 6|
log |a + 10|


# IF statments

|a| = |10|
|b| = |11|

If | a>b | {
	Log |"This will never get logged!"|
} 

If | a>b | {
	Log |"a is greater"|
} else {
	Log |"b is greater"|
}

If | b>a | {
	Log |"b is greater again"|
}  else {
	Log |"a is greater"|
}
